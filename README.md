# Password Generator Using JavaScript : Week 3 Challenge

## Description of Project

In this project we were tasked with writing JavaScript code that enabled the password generator to offer users with password options on the front-end and generate a random password on the back-end. 

We created functions, levaraged the power of using strings and other built in objects that made the application functional.
